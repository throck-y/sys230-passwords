    checkLegality: This is an attempt to avert an exception in the event that a file needs to be created
                   by making sure the user's inputted file name will be accepted by the host OS (Certain

             only call this if you're using it for your own class, don't pass a hash to System\
             ~~internal use only~~
    
    firstTime: creates files if they are not found
               System handles this, calling this externally will catastrophically break everything

    fileCreate: Creates file in the OS.
                file creation is handled internally, calling this will probably overwrite something and break it
